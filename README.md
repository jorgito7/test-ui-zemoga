Test for UI Zemoga


## Layout HTML-CSS
For the page, I used semantic HTML5, I used Pure CSS3 for the styles, except for the Icons, where I used font-awesome.min.css
Requirements:

I decided to use Pure CSS, because it is a better way to show the selectors and Specificity concepts.

I didn't create the landing pages for the header menu items (I didn't have enough time). However I had used the common folder to add the header that is common on all pages.

I have a little visual issue with the vote cards!. (The percent bar moves depending the description content). But is simple to correct (just add a bottom:0 style and make it position absolute), but I don't have enough time

Requirements:

 I used Vanilla Javascript, 
For the persistence, I used the Session (sessionStorage).
It needs to be runned on a server side (i used http-server -p8000 command for run it)
 Bonus points: Some sort of Test (E2E, BDD, etc) I don't enough time, However if you give me 1 more day, I could Add it.
